## About Me

I am the Head of Data Science at Lightspark and am currently based in Los Angeles, CA. 

Prior to Lightspark, I was a Research Scientist at Meta, where I helped build the Diem (previously known as Libra) cryptocurrency. 

I also received my Ph.D in Economics from Stanford University. My Ph.D focused on using applied microeconomics, field experiments, and big data to answer important policy questions related around developing economies and poverty. 

I am originally from Seattle, WA. In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports (snowboarding, surfing, ultimate frisbee), playing music (piano and guitar), and exploring the world.
